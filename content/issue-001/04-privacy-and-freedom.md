### 🕊️ What Freedom Means in Open Source

When people talk about *free software*, they don’t just mean the price — they mean **freedom**. Freedom to see how your tools work. Freedom to share them. Freedom to fix them, improve them, or build something entirely new.

Most of the technology we use every day — phones, apps, even smart TVs — is designed to keep us out. We can’t see what’s happening behind the scenes, and we’re often tracked, advertised to, or locked into “walled gardens.”

Open source flips that script. It’s software built by communities, not corporations. Anyone can read the code, suggest improvements, and share it freely. That openness creates **trust, collaboration, and independence** — the same values that inspired the Linux movement in the first place.

When you use open-source software, you’re not just saving money — you’re supporting a more transparent, ethical, and democratic way of using technology.
