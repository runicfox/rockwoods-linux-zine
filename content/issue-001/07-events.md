## Events

### Tuesday, November 25th 2025 at the Eureka Hills Branch Library 

Join us for the first meeting of the Rockwoods Linux Group! We’re a friendly community of open-source enthusiasts who want to explore, learn, and support each other in using Linux and other free software. Whether you’ve been running Linux for years or you’re just wondering what it’s all about, you’re welcome here.

At this kickoff session, we’ll have a couple of Linux computers available to try out, plus live USB drives you can use on your own laptop to test-drive different Linux distributions - no installation required. We’ll also talk about what kinds of topics and activities people would like to see in future meetings, from privacy and security to gaming, creative tools, and install parties.

Come for the curiosity, stay for the community. Bring your questions, your laptop (if you’d like), and your interest in open-source tech!

**Duration**: 90 minutes

**Who it’s for**: Everyone. No technical experience required

**What to bring**: Optional laptop, your curiosity, and an open mind!
