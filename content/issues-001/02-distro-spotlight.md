## Distro Spotlight

Ubuntu is one of the most popular and beginner-friendly Linux distributions, and for good reason. It’s built around the idea that software should be free, secure, and easy for anyone to use. The desktop version offers a clean, modern interface that feels familiar to anyone coming from Windows or macOS, while still giving you the freedom and privacy that come with open-source software.

Ubuntu is backed by a large, supportive community and gets regular updates, so it’s both stable and well-maintained. It comes with everything you need right out of the box—web browser, office apps, media player, and access to thousands more through its built-in software store. Whether you’re reviving an older laptop or exploring something new, Ubuntu is a great place to start your Linux journey.
