## Mission statement

The Rockwoods Linux Group is a community of curious minds and open-source enthusiasts dedicated to promoting the use and understanding of free and open-source software (FOSS), especially the Linux operating system. 

We welcome everyone, from complete beginners to seasoned tech users, who share an interest in learning, exploring, and helping others. Our group hosts events and discussions on topics like privacy, security, and open-source alternatives to proprietary software. 

More than anything, we’re a supportive community built on sharing knowledge, empowering users, and encouraging digital freedom.

#### “Why we’re making a zine”
Zine culture is a do-it-yourself publishing movement rooted in self-expression and community. Born from punk, art, and activist circles, zines are small, handmade publications that bypass mainstream media—celebrating independence, creativity, and the sharing of ideas on one’s own terms.

Zines are by their nature "open-source."  Many, including this one, are made in small batches, assembled by hand, and distributed to the local community for the purposes of sharing knowledge, raising awareness, and building community.
